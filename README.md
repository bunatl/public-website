# Lukas Bunat's personal website

## Description
This project serves as a codebase for a personal website. However, it was created with intentions to be a demo portfolio project as well.

Since the project is a decent size website a lot of structuring, designing and styling had to be done in order to maximize user experience. There are some known points that are in a backlog, waiting to be done/solved.

⚠ **Currently still in development!** ⚠
