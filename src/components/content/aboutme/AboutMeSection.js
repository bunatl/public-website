        <p>I am a tech enthusiastic born in Prague, Czech Republic. I have had studied at many different universities all over the world and I take great pride in my international experience. It showed and taught me different approaches on how to deal with problems. I believe in learning by mistakes and simply by trying. I also like to share my opinions - on my website. I always do my best to achieve my dreams and goals. Because no one else would do it for me. Over time I found out that I can easily learn new things and make a good decision. I believe it is also thanks to my vast knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started as a software developer with languages such as C, C++ and JAVA where the main objectives were speed, efficiency and design patterns. Later, I have found my passion for Full-Stack and since then I put my focus into web development. In the future, I want to learn blockchain technologies. I do see huge potential in these technologies. On the other hand, in almost every application, there is a need for data processing and management. Therefore my knowledge about data storing in data warehouses, getting information/knowledge through BI or Knowledge Discovery in Databases/Datasets. And lastly, of course, cornerstone language for data - SQL/No-SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't just code, I have a wide range of analytics and systematic skills that helps me finding clever solutions for improving/creating optimal programs.
