        I am a tech enthusiastic born in Prague, Czech Republic. I have had studied at many
        different universities all over the world and I take great pride in my international
        experience. It showed and taught me different approaches on how to deal with
        problems. I always do my best to achieve my dreams and goals. Over time I found
        out that I can easily learn new things and make a good decision. I believe it is also
        thanks to my vast knowledge.

        I started as a software developer with languages such as C, C++ and JAVA where the
        main objectives were speed, efficiency and design patterns. Later, I have found my
        passion for Full-Stack and since then I put my focus into web development. In the
        future, I want to learn blockchain technologies. As I do see huge potential in these
        technologies. However, I don't just code, I have a wide range of analytics and
        systematic skills that helps me finding clever solutions for improving/creating
        optimal programs.
